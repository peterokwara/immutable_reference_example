# Immutable Reference Example

This project illustrates the concept of an Immutable Reference. Files can be stored on a decentralized storage (IPFS) and the resulting hash stored on the IOTA tangle. To avoid any fraud, the hash of a given document can be compared with one on the blockchain to determine if it's genuine or not.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have nodejs installed on your machine.

## Installation

Enter the main directory and run

```bash
npm install
```
To install all the dependencies

## Usage

The project needs to be built before running it. To do this run:

```bash
npm nun build
```

Once the build process is complete, a separate folder called `dist` is created. To run the project, you can run:

```bash
npm run start
```
